# Bet SGP

A mobile first application that allows for users to predict the outcome of the Speedway World Championships. From late April to early October, 10 annual Speedway Grand Prix (GP) events make the ground for the World Championships.

Each GP consists of 16 riders. They race 4 at a time, 5 races each, 20 races in total. The 8 best riders move on to the semifinals, and the 2 best from each semifinal will compete in the grand finale.

As a user of this application, you pick three riders in each GP, and collect the points that these riders collect in each race (3 for first place, 2 for second place, 1 for third place and 0 for last place). You are free to change your picks as many times as you like, until the start time of each GP.

The app will keep track of the leaderboards, for each GP as well as the total standings. You will also be able to navigate through your own stats, and compare your results to others.
